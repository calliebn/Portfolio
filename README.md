# Portfolio
A portfolio of my work

A responsive portfolio containing my resume and links to a few projects that I created using HTML and CSS.

The page should resize to fit the device that it is being viewed on. It contains both internal anchor links as well as links to websites that I created previously.

I think that I hit all of the requirements, but please let me know if there are areas that I can improve.

Thanks for your feedback!
